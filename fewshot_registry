Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.

If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\cdot15\cdot n=30n$ pounds.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.",
